One huge difference between using a method and using a function is parameter evaluation time.
In Java, one can write a method taking some arguments and returning a value. Is this a function? Not at all.
A method can't be manipulated in any other way than calling it, and this implies that its arguments will
be evaluated before the method is executed. This is a consequence of arguments being passed by value in Java.

Functions are different. One may manipulate functions without evaluating them. And one has complete control
over when the arguments are evaluated. And if a function has several arguments, they may be evaluated at
different time. This may be done through the use of currying. But first, we will see how this may be done with closures.
